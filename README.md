<h3>Introduction</h3>

Hello! Over the last few months, I have been conducting some analytics the quality of content on HIVE. As no one author can be directly compared to another, because we all have our unique styles and posting niches, I have instead decided to build a tool that has many use cases. 

Load the page, type in a username. Press a button. You can Fetch All the Posts made by a user, or just the last 100. For accounts with a long history of posting, like mine, it takes a while to gather the content from HIVE API end points. 

In summary, this tool presents: 

- An Author Overview
- Post length timeline
- Posting Trends
- Words Published Over Time
- Readability over Time 
- Readability Distribution
- Word Count Distribution
- Post Archive, filterable by Reading Level
- Export Functions for further analysis 

<h3>Use Cases for This Tool</h3>

I envision that this tool can be used by those seeking to improve their own writing (by making it easier to understand) - or to review prior content in a bid to understand their writing styles and methods more deeply. 

Other use cases exist for curation - has the author seen a sudden uptick in readability, content length, or have they taken a long break from Hive? 

<h1>Tool Components</h1>

<h3>Author Overview</h3>

Once the data is retrieved you get a neat little scorecard:

This is not a dashboard about *earning*. This is a dashboard of publishing activity, and how "sticky" the user is to the Hive Platform. You can see the date of the first post, the most recent post - and a number of other things.

The Total Number of Posts the User has made. How many posts per day? 

What was the longest uninterrupted streak of posting? When was it? Did they take a break from posting? How long was their longest break? 

How many total words have they published to the chain? How many average words? How many images? How many images per post? How many words per picture? How many pictures per word? 

All these questions are answered. You can see my data above :) 

The next section is about the trend of posts.

<h3>Post Content Summary</h3>

You can see that with a <em>long</em> list of posts, the chart gets very busy, but at a glance, I published a lot of images (compared to words) in 2021, which lines up with when I was able to go off and pursue my photography as the world opened up again.

<h3>Posting Trends</h3>

What days, years, months, and hours of the day has the user been active?

<h3>Word Count Mountain &  Readability</h3>

I've *nearly* published a million words to HIVE. I didn't know that before this tool.

The lower chart here shows readability over time, I am pretty static, but there are some excursions where my writing is *incredibly* dense and hart to understand, being the lower numbers.

<h3>Readability and Word Count</h3>

The readability statistics are derived from the [Flesch Kincaid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch%E2%80%93Kincaid_readability_tests) methodology of categorising content by what level of education in English a reader may require to understand the content. Simple language is good English, but we all get "flowery" and complex from time to time.

How this is actually calculated is summarised by the following screenshot from WikiPedia:

<h3> Post History</h3>

The post history lists the Title, Author, Date, Time, word count (Derived by counting the number of spaces in the text) - the number of images (by counting the incidence of certain file extensions in the text), and finally, the readability score, along with a link to the post. 

You can sort  by the readability level.

You are also able to export the content for further analysis, either as a CSV or a JSON. Note that some CSV readers may fail to render columns elegantly where a post has thousands and thousands of characters / words. 


<h3>[Use the tool here!](https://holoz0r.github.io/HiveReportCard/)</h3>

[If you like this tool, please vote to support my witness](https://vote.hive.uno/@holoz0r). 

I will **not** be making an application for DHF funding for this tool. This tool is about **content**. 

For a long time I have believed that **content is what will bring value to HIVE**. 

I believe that this is a tool that is simple, that anyone can use to become more aware of their own writing complexity, and see some more granularity about their HIVE blockchain history. Perhaps it will lure interested writers *to* HIVE so they can analyse their own writing.

Thank you for reading. I look forward to seeing your views and trends in the comments. Share it with a friend, etc.  :)
