## [Use the Tool Here](https://holoz0r.github.io/HiveReportCard/)

I am writing this post so that I have more up to date documentation for the Hive Report Card. I am now in a state where I am happy with the implemented features. I thank the members of the Hive Blockchain for their support and enthusiasm for this tool. If you wish to express this, you can support [my witness node](https://vote.hive.uno/@holoz0r).

# Features

### Summary Cards (Improved!) 

Results below are from my own account:

You will notice that there are now emojis, content classification, and a new metric - posts per week!  

Astute observers will also notice that the word count calculation is improved. This was due to some bugs in the regex that was counting words. 

#### Top 5 Longest Breaks and Streaks (New!)

Interested to know when you were idle or super active? You can now go tell!

#### Analytics by Period (NEW!!!)

This table is the brainchild of @azircon , and it makes so much sense to have available, when I see it before my eyes. I struggled to understand what value it would bring at first, but now that I see it, I think it speaks for itself.

This feature will prove very valuable for onboarding projects and people who refer people to HIVE, as they will be able to keep a close eye on the activity of their new users, or the users they are helping to foster.

#### Words and Images Per Post (Filtering by Time Periods)

You can now zoom into the charts that have a time series, and change the resolution by Day,Week,Month or Year. 

If you prefer to see them as cards, that is implemented as well.

I will **not** be making an application for DHF funding for this tool. This tool is about **content**. 

For a long time I have believed that **content is what will bring value to HIVE**. 

I believe that this is a tool that is simple, that anyone can use to become more aware of their own writing complexity, and see some more granularity about their HIVE blockchain history. Perhaps it will lure interested writers *to* HIVE so they can analyse their own writing.
